# TaskScheduler
Hi, I am Adam and i have created a Task Scheduler program.
## Overview

TaskScheduler is a Python-based program designed to help users determine whether a given task can be completed within a specified deadline based on the task's duration. The program calculates the task completion time and compares it against the provided deadline. Additionally, the program can show how much time remains until the deadline and the exact time when the task will be completed.

## Features

- Calculate whether a task can be completed before a specified deadline.
- Determine the exact time a task will be completed.
- Display the remaining time until the deadline.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `datetime` module (included by default in Python)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TaskScheduler.git
   cd TaskScheduler
python task_scheduler.py
